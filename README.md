## About

**Noteify** is a powerful and compact notepad designed in Java for Android. Keeping track of your thoughts has never been easier!

This project has been originally developed in 2021 with the aim of learning more about the process of building mobile applications. In 2023 the app went through a refactor process, with the repository cleaned up and re-uploaded.

## Features

Some of the main Noteify features
* ability to create, edit and delete notes
* search bar which helps you find specific notes by their title or content
* automatic light/dark theme based on system settings
* modern and responsive UI design

## Technologies

The project uses
* **Java 8** - the application's core logic, general functionality
* **Android Room persistence library** - used to create and manage the notes database
* **SDP library** - provides easier support for different screen sizes
* **Gradle** - a default build automation tool

## Launch

* you need **Android 8.0 (API level 26) or greater** for the application to work properly
* if you experience performance issues, try force stopping and clearing the app's cache
* clearing application data will delete the entire notes database, please proceed with caution
