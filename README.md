**Noteify** is a powerful and compact notepad designed in Java for Android. Keeping track of your thoughts has never been easier!

This project has been originally developed in 2021 with the aim of learning more about the process of building mobile applications. In 2023 the app went through a refactor process, with the repository cleaned up and re-uploaded.
